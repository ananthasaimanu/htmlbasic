<br><p id="Story">Shanmugham (aka Benz) is a taxi driver in the quiet hill town of Perunad, Ranni, Pathanamthitta, Kerala, who lives with his wife Lalitha and their two children. After a series of funny incidents in the family, Benz travels to Madras following the death of his employer. Upon returning, he realizes that his car has been seized by the police on narcotics charges, as it was used to transport drugs by Maniyan, a mechanic working in Kuttychan's workshop. After numerous attempts and several suggestions to speak with the Circle Inspector, George Mathan, Benz finally gets his car back. However, George asks him to drive himself, Sub-Inspector Benny, and Constable Sudeesh to attend Sudeesh’s sister’s wedding. After the wedding, they instruct Benz to drive them to Sudeesh’s farmhouse in the mountains. Though suspicious, Benz complies until a certain point where he refuses to go further. At this moment, George reveals that they have murdered someone—Sudeesh’s sister’s ex-boyfriend—who had been stalking her and threatening her with compromising videos. Petrified, Benz is forced to stay in the car while the three officers bury the body. He returns home deeply shaken, and his disturbed behavior is noticed by Lalitha, who questions the bloodstain on his shirt. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Benz burns the stained shirt and avoids answering calls from Benny and George.</span>

    Amidst this, Benz realizes that Pavi, his son, is not answering his calls. Concerned, he checks on him at his hostel, only to discover that the attendance register shows Pavi was last present two days ago. Alarmed, Benz reports him missing to the police. As he exits the station, he spots Pavi’s bike in the police yard. When he asks Benny about it, Benny casually claims that the bike has been there for two to three months. Convinced that something terrible has happened to Pavi, Benz locates the wallet of the deceased, he earlier dropped when Lalitha came over to him. The wallet is then shown to be of his son, Pavi. Heartbroken and devastated, he vows revenge. He kidnaps Sudeesh and takes him to Kambam, where Sudeesh confesses that he only learned about the murder at the same time Benz did, and that he was brought along because he knew the forest routes. Benz uses Sudeesh’s phone to call George and warns him that he knows the truth. Coincidentally, a landslide occurs, and during rescue operations in the affected areas, the buried body is found. The report confirms it is Pavi’s.
    
    George visits Benz’s home and informs Lalitha, her daughter, Kuttychan, and Shaji about the body, falsely claiming that Benz killed Pavi. Lalitha and her daughter gets falsely arrested by Benny, who tortures them into fabricating a story that Benz killed Pavi because he was Lalitha’s son from a previous marriage and that he abused his stepsister. In Kambam, George tells the same lie to Benz, who becomes enraged and attacks George in the lodge. George reveals that the police are waiting outside. Benz attempts to flee but is caught and arrested. He is taken back to Ranni, where Lalitha and their daughter are released, but Benz is confined to a basement-like room. George and Benny spread the false story to the media, framing Benz for his own son’s murder. Benz is brought to trial, but before that, during George’s retirement celebration, he orders some police camp trainees to kill Benz. However, Benz overpowers them, kills Benny, and uses Benny’s phone to call George. He threatens to kill George’s daughter, Mary, in revenge.
    
    Panicked, George rushes home, only to find Benz waiting. A violent fight breaks out in the rain. George screams, demanding to know where Mary is, and Benz reveals that he sent Mary to where Pavi was, but in reality was watching everything unfold. In a flashback, it is revealed that Mary and Pavi were in a relationship, which George disapproved of. George, who already murdered his wife, found out about their relationship and called Pavi to the police station. There, he brutally beat Pavi and, in a fit of rage, struck him with a helmet, rendering him unconscious. As Benny pointed out that Pavi was still alive, George suffocated him to death. They then stored Pavi’s body in the trunk of Benz’s car.
    
    With George and Benny dead, Benz remains haunted by the loss of his son but finds some relief in having avenged his death. Pavi’s funeral is held, where Lalitha breaks down in grief, and Mary joins the family as Pavi’s partner. When Benz is taken to court for trial, he refuses to cover his face. When asked by the media if he killed his son, he replies, “I did not kill my son; I killed the people who killed my son.” He then sees Lalitha and his daughter sitting outside the courthouse and walks in to face justice.
